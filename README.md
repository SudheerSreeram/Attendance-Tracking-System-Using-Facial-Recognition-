Attendance Tracking System Using Facial Recognition

Description:

Project Goal:
The objective of this project was to develop an efficient and automated attendance tracking system using facial recognition technology. The system aims to eliminate manual attendance tracking methods, reduce errors, and enhance security in schools, offices, and other institutions.

Development Process:

Implemented a facial recognition algorithm using OpenCV and deep learning models to detect and recognize faces accurately.
Developed a user-friendly web and mobile application to allow real-time attendance monitoring and reporting.
Integrated a database to store attendance records securely and generate detailed reports for administrators.
Used Python for backend development, Flask/Django for the web framework, and a cloud-based service for scalability.
Key Features:

Automated Face Detection & Recognition: Captures and verifies faces in real time.
Real-time Attendance Marking: Automatically marks attendance upon successful face recognition.
Cloud-based Storage & Reporting: Securely stores attendance data and generates reports.
Multi-user Role Access: Provides different access levels for students/employees, teachers/managers, and administrators.
Integration with Existing Systems: Can be linked with HRMS, school ERP, or payroll systems.
Spoof Detection: Prevents fraudulent attendance marking using AI-based liveness detection.
